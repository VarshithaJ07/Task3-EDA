# Task3-EDA
This task performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two datasets — Netflix Titles and Iris. The analysis includes data cleaning, distribution analysis, outlier detection, and visual insights using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Key findings show that Netflix content is dominated by Movies, mature ratings (TV-MA), and recent releases, while the Iris dataset shows clear species separability with strong correlations between petal features. The results confirm meaningful patterns in both datasets, useful for further modeling and interpretation.
